# OrangeHRM – Manual Testing Project

## 🧪 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my hands-on **manual testing experience** on the **OrangeHRM (Open Source Demo)** web application.  
I performed requirement analysis, test planning, test case design, manual execution, defect reporting, and traceability to validate application quality.

The primary focus of testing was the **ESS – My Info module**, which is actively used by end users in real-world HR systems.

## 👤 Role
**Manual Test Engineer (Fresher Project)**

---

## 🖥 Application Under Test
- **Application Name:** OrangeHRM  
- **Application Type:** Human Resource Management System  
- **URL:** https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com  

---

## 📌 Modules Covered
- **Admin Module** (pre-requisite setup only)
- **ESS Module**
  - My Info (Core testing scope)

---

## 🎯 Scope of Testing
Manual testing activities included:
- Functional testing (positive & negative scenarios)
- Field-level and form validations
- Login validation
- File upload validation
- UI and usability checks
- Basic regression testing

---

## 🧰 Test Environment
- **Operating System:** Windows  
- **Browser:** Google Chrome  
- **Testing Type:** Manual Functional Testing  

---

## 📂 Test Artifacts
The following testing documents were created and executed as part of this project:
1. Functional Requirement Specification (FRS)
2. Test Plan
3. Test Scenarios
4. Test Cases
5. Test Execution Report
6. Bug Report
7. Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
8. Decision Table

## 📊 Test Execution Summary
Manual test execution was carried out based on approved test cases and requirements.

| Metric | Count |
|------|------|
| Total Test Cases Designed | 67 |
| Total Test Cases Executed | 67 |
| Test Cases Passed | 57 |
| Test Cases Failed | 9 |
| Test Cases Partially Passed | 1 |
| Test Cases Blocked | 0 |

---

## 🪲 Defect Summary

| Severity | Count |
|--------|------|
| Medium (S3) | 9 |
| High / Critical | 0 |

- Defects were logged with clear **steps to reproduce**, **expected vs actual results**, and proper severity.
- All failed test cases were mapped to corresponding defect IDs.

---

## 🔍 Execution Details
- All test cases were executed **manually** on the OrangeHRM demo application.
- Defects were mainly related to:
  - Validation messages
  - File upload behavior
  - UI inconsistencies
- Retesting and basic regression scope was identified after defect logging.

---

## 🔁 Requirement Traceability
A **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** was prepared to ensure:
- Every requirement is mapped to test scenarios and test cases
- Complete test coverage with no missing requirements

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Skills Demonstrated
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
- Requirement analysis using FRS
- Writing effective test scenarios and test cases
- Manual test execution and result analysis
- Professional defect reporting
- Requirement traceability and test coverage analysis

---

## ✅ Final Outcome
Based on manual testing results:
- The **core ESS – My Info functionality is stable**
- No critical or blocking defects were identified
- Reported defects were mainly validation and UI-related

This project reflects practical manual testing skills expected from an entry-level QA professional.

## 📌 Note
All testing artifacts and execution results in this repository are based on **actual manual testing performed by me** on the OrangeHRM demo application.
